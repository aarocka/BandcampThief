id3v2 - A command line id3v2 tag editor.  
http://id3v2.sourceforge.net

In case you didn't know id3 tags can be found on mp3 files, they can store
infomation about what band recorded the song, the song name, etc.

I wrote this because id3v1 are seriously deficient in what kind of info can
be in them and the length of info that can be in them.  id3v2 tags are much
better but there isn't a tool to edit them in Linux.  This is a tool to fill
that space.

See INSTALL for directions on building id3v2.

As of version 0.1.10 this code is under the LGPL.  A lot of it is based off
the examples in id3lib, but there is some code from me :).

thanks goes out to:

Antti Andreimann - patch to write only one version of tag

Vladimir Pastukhov - patch to handle General object frames w/o segfaulting

Errica Crome - patch to fix genre display.

Branko Radovanovic <branko-r at users.sf.net> - 
  patch 1:
    - No more seg faults for: --IPLS, --UFID, --PCNT, --
    POPM. Note that these still merely print the info (i.e. the
    file is *not* changed).
    
    - No more seg faults for --comment. And the new code
    actually *sets* the comment.
    
    - No more seg faults for --TXXX desc:text.
    
    - "TSIZ results in unrecognized option" now fixed.
    
    Also rearranged some redundant code and made several
    minor changes (a bit more consistent coding style,
    spelling, etc.) 

  patch 2:
     
    In PrintID3v1Tag() fread() in fact returns size_t (number
    of items read), which is unsigned, and the error
    reporting code is thus never executed. Fixed now.
    
    BTW, it would probably be a good idea to compile with "-
    W -Wall pedantic". This is how I caught it.    
  (I've changed the make file as he suggested)

    Attached patch deletes id3v2 tags when passed an empty
    string, rather than just setting them to a null string.
    I.e. -a "" will delete the artist tag. Works for
    comments too: -c "ID3v1 Comment::XXX" will delete the
    default comment derived from the v1 tag.

	When a file has an unknown genre (number 255) the program dies with a
	segmentation fault.  When applied to list.cpp the patch should correct
	that by printing "Unknown" as the genre.

    I attach a few patches for the id3v2 tool you're responsible for. Maybe
    it's useful to apply them, 'cause at the moment the implementation
    doesn't conforms the ANSI C++ standard. (I didn't check the whole source
    but those lines which causes the error).
